## Background
Jimmy Sweat is an ambitious entrepreneur with a passion for snowboarding. His goal is to create a collaborative website to make this sport known to the general public and to help people learn tricks.

He wishes to capitalize on content provided by Internet users in order to develop a rich content that will arouse the interest of the site's users. Then, Jimmy wishes to develop a business of connection with snowboard brands thanks to the traffic that the content will have generated.

For this project, we will focus on the technical creation of the site for Jimmy.

## Description of the need
You are in charge of developing the site to meet Jimmy's needs. You have to implement the following features :

a directory of snowboard tricks. You can be inspired by the list of tricks on Wikipedia. Just add 10 tricks, the rest will be entered by the users;
figure management (creation, modification, consultation);
a common discussion space for all figures.
To implement these features, you must create the following pages:

the home page where the list of figures will appear;
the page for creating a new figure;
